# PBL4-FaceRecognitionApp
 
The facial recognition application is developed using the Python programming language. You can train a model with new faces, run your application on your computer, or use your computer as a server to recognize faces using the Rasbery pi's remote camera. When the face is recognized, the servo engine rotates.
